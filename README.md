## Usage

Call the `mint` function with the desired address and value. This will increase the total token supply and the balance of the given address.

```solidity
mint(address _address, uint value)


### Burning Tokens

Call the `burn` function with the desired address and value. This will decrease the total token supply and the balance of the given address.Ensures that the balance of the address is sufficient to burn the specified amount i.e balances[_address] >= _value

```solidity
burn(address _address, uint value)
